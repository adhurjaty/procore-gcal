1. What types of events should we handle?
    - Change orders / change events
    - Open Observations
    - Open inspection
    - Maybe transmittals
    - Open punchlist
    - Due dates for all items

2. What information should we move from each type of event
    1. Submittal - final due date and submit by date
    2. RFI
3. How should we handle collobaration - just copy them to the event?
4. Is this the type of app you could install on your own?
5. How do you want to engage with this?
    1. Change settings routinely?
    2. Behind the scenes?
